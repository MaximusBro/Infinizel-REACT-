						<p>Infinizal is a pet-project, or rather a project to
							improve developer skills.In fact,
							it is a demonstration of Frontend developer skills.
							This project should not be viewed as a commercial
							project, and I do not claim the design,
							I found it on the Internet (link at the end).
							Thank you for taking the time to look at my work </p>
